                    <p className="ab_info">It started in 2015 when I was very dissatisfied with my hair. I was spending a lot of money on salon hair color and purchasing expensive shampoos and conditioners and yet my hair kept getting drier, frizzier and more sparse.  I was using fragrance free facial cleansers and lotions at the time because it was better for my sensitive skin.  I wanted the same for my hair.</p>
                    <p className="ab_info">I couldn't find fragrance free hair care that actually made my hair look and feel better. So I used my years of education in chemistry and lab sciences to create my own. I used the Whole Foods Premium Product ingredients guidelines as my starting point.</p>
                    <p className="ab_info">As a scuba diver, Iâ€™ve seen what plastic and chemicals can do to our oceans.  So creating a product that is biodegradable and limits the use of plastic is also very important to me.  I look for nature-based ingredients that are not only sustainable and biodegradable but also gentle and effective.  Our bottles are 100% aluminum (recyclable) and the labels can be easily peeled off because no glues are used.  (We encourage reuse of the pumps.)</p>
                    <p className="ab_info">Today, my hair feels and looks so much better. Yours will too.</p>
